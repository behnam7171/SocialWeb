The open graph contained information about title, description, type, site_name, image, image:width, image:height, url of the website. These information are presented as meta tag inside HTML code. And the content of these tags are pressented inside the HTML code, But in Schema.org markup the url to specific subject in schema.org website is presented in attribute of html element and the actual description is in the schema.org link so that google and other search engine can know what the website is about.\n",

Schema.org contains more information than Open Graph and widely used for search engines while Open Graph mainly focuses on social media websites (specifically facebook).
