    "## Social Network Analysis Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our literature work, Most researches that used social network analysis aproaches to find experts tried to use PageRank and applied some feature of their dataset to the algorithm. We shall do the same and we considered score of answers as feature of our dataset to indicate experties of each user.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the <code>aggregate</code> function counts the number of times a user answered another user as feature. and the <code>aggregate_with_scores</code> considers scores of answeres each user got to another user's questions in specific tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a parameter called damping factor which indicates the probability of jumping to another node when algorithm stuck in the loop. In practice 0.85 is the best number for real data use. damping factor in the networkx is known as <code>alpha</code> which is an argument but since the default value that networkx also chose is 0.85, we did not pass it throught the pagerank method. pagerank algorthm is recersive algorithm which we must state how many times it should be run. As much more as it runs, the scores of each nodes starts to tend to reach a number and after some iteration, they will not change which is the point that score of pagerank is final. networkx has argument of <code>max_iter</code> that is the number of iteration that algorithm runs which by default is 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "After calculating the pagerank of each node, we need to sort the score to see which node has highest score (importance) in the graph. Based on scenario of our graph which is a directed graph, that means that user has the highest experties."

    "## Evaluation\n",
    "Before we introduce our evaluation methods, we must introduce which data we are comparing our data to.\n",
    "For our research we found this link on <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/tags/python/topusers\">stackoverflow website</a>. In this website we see the top users in python tag. But we need this data for the date range that we used for our research. So we need to extract our own data from stackoverflow to get this top users in tags. And not to mention that this link shows top user for specific tag. But we aimed to find all tags related to python. for example that link only shows top users in tag \"python\" but this is not only tag related to python. There are tags like \"python-2.7\", \"python-idle\" and etc that must be considered because they are also related to subject \"python\".\n",
    "For this purpose we proposed our own query to extract the top users from stackoverflow. Based on the mentioned link above, top users that stackoverflow release (data on this link is updated weekly) are based on scores of answer they give in specific tag. So we conducted our own query to extract this data. The query is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` mysql\n",
    "select a.OwnerUserId as Answerer_ID, sum(a.score) as Sum_Answerer_Score\n",
    "from posts as q join posts as a on  q.Id = a.ParentId join users as u on a.OwnerUserId = u.Id\n",
    "where q.CreationDate < GETDATE()\n",
    "and   q.CreationDate >= '2021-01-01 00:00:00'\n",
    "and   q.PostTypeId = 1\n",
    "and   a.PostTypeId = 2\n",
    "and   a.OwnerUserId IS NOT NULL\n",
    "and   q.Tags LIKE '%python%'\n",
    "group by a.OwnerUserId\n",
    "order by Sum_Answerer_Score desc\n",
    "```\n",
    "This query aims to get data from start of 2021 until the day that the day query is running. So be aware that the csv files that you see in the project files are for queries that was run on 12/4/2021\n",
    "\n",
    "to test our query you can remove the CreationDate conditions and see which users are top users of tags in python and compare it with data in the <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/tags/python/topusers\">stackoverflow website</a>. Be aware that you must see abit of difference in number for 2 reasons:\n",
    "1- the data on that link is not updated frequently (only weekly)\n",
    "2- we consider multiple tags that are related to \"python\" but the link only considers tag \"python\". So defenetly numbers of scores that you see in the result of our query must be a bit higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we are going to do 2 evaluation on our work:\n",
    "1- TOPK: In this evaluation we aim to see how many of our top k users appeared in top k users that considered top users in stackoverflow.\n",
    "2- Spearman Correlation: The TOPK evaluation helps us know how good was our expert detection process. But it does not give us good information how was precision of our ranking process. That is why we considered spearman correlation to determine the correlation between ranking that stackoverflow gives and ranking that we found after process of expert finding"

    "The results of evaluations shows that using the scores have better performance in finding experts in PageRank and In-degree algorithms. eigenvector algorithm had the worse performance among the algorithms we tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of evaluations also show that indegree centralization is the algorithm with better performance. But is it the final algorithm that must be used?\n",
    "\n",
    "We must say no. Because Stackoverflow used score of answers in specific tag to determine the top users and if we take a close look, in-degree does the exact same thing. if we look at <code>aggregate_with_score</code> it also sums the scores of answers each user gave. So basically what in-degree does and what stackoverflow considers as top users are the same. The reason there result of first evaluation (topk) is not 100% and second evaluation(spearman correlation) is not 1 in the in-degree algorithm is that we used only accepted answers in stackoverflow (the answers with green tick beside them) just to make sure users that gave the best answers be in our evaluation, because we can not be sure that other answers are accurate also we removed negative edges from the graph in the preprocess phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we argue that why we choose pagerank as final algorithm that we use. Because simply sum the answers of each user can not be enough. PageRank algorithm considers the chain effect of answers. For example If user B answers user A question in specific tag and user C answers user B question, then there is a chance that user C has more experties than both of them. And part of expertise point should be credited to user C, because user C could answer C could answer another potential expert (user B).\n",
